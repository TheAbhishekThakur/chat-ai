# Potential Enhancements

## 1. Persist Conversation History:

Store past messages in a database to provide users with a seamless experience by displaying their previous conversations upon returning.

## 2. Functional Header Icons: 

Some icons in the header currently lack functionality. We can enhance the user experience by implementing relevant features for these icons based on requirements.

## 3. Smooth UI Animations: 

Adding subtle animations can improve the interface's visual appeal, making interactions feel more dynamic and engaging.

## 4. Pixel-Perfect Design:
 
While the UI may have minor deviations from the provided image, having access to a Figma design file would enable us to achieve an exact match.

## 5. Secure API Handling:

Implementing environment variables (.env files) ensures that sensitive information, such as API URLs and keys, remains secure and is not exposed in the codebase.
